### R code for modeling progression of clinical severity in Rett Syndrome

This repository contains relevent R code and output in Jupyter notebooks 
and serves as a supplement to the following publication:

Any comments or questions should be directed to Jonathan Merritt

xci_datacleaning.ipynb contains the algorithmic process used to correct 
logical inconsistencies in clinical severity scores pulled from the 
Natural History of Rett Syndrome & Related Disorders study. Examples
of the data cleaning output are provided as embedded tables in this
document.

xci_model_build_and_prediction.ipynb contains the various steps used
to build, validate, and apply a model of clinical severity. Several
figures from the publication are also embedded in this document.

xci_analysis.ipynb contains analysis of the contribution of 
X chromosome inactivation to clinical severity using normative
severity scores generated using the predictive model above. Additional
figures from the publication are embedded in this document.
